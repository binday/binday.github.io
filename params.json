Helping them easily find out what goes in which bin and when they are collected. \r\nThe goal is to encourage recycling and highlight deficiencies. For example, which councils don't collect certain items from the doorstep and force people to drive to a recycling point.\r\n\r\nAnyone will be able to submit changes to correct information via a pull request.\r\n","google":"UA-66668834-1","note":"Don't delete this file!

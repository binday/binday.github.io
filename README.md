# Bin Day UK

## List of Bin Collection Days in the UK

[![Bin Day Logo](binday.png)](https://binday.uk)

**Work in progress...**

Currently there's:
 - https://www.gov.uk/rubbish-collection-day 
 - https://www.gov.uk/recycling-collections

These simply look up your council by postcode and deep link to their site (many of the links are dead).
I think we can do better than that.

This site aims to be a comprehensive list pointing users to bin collections and recycling information. Helping them easily find out what goes in which bin and when they are collected. 
The goal is to encourage recycling and highlight deficiencies. For example, which councils don't collect certain items from the doorstep and force people to drive to a recycling point.

Anyone will be able to submit changes to correct information via a pull request.
